            <h2>Design Brief:</h2>
            <p>
                With this project we'll begin the exploration of virtual environments. We'll look at how digital spaces can emulate or build upon the physical realm, and we'll take on the spaces that are not possible or not necessary in the material world, but present us with some exciting creative possibilities in the digital medium.

                The project is not centered around a specific tool, but is rather meant to be an overview of (some) conventions, constraints, and opportunities in the digital 3D space.
                
                The outcome of this project will be an environment you can call your digital home on the Web. Consider not only the elements that you would like to include but also the kinds of activities that your environment would be suitable for.

            <h2>Documentation:</h2>
            <p>
                I took the prompt for this project very literally, and created a 3D model of a recurring dream I had as a child. In this dream, I’m in the desert at night, alone, and it’s raining. The only thing around is a solitary McDonalds, and I can’t get in. In my 3D space, I wanted to be able to enter the restaurant, to create a space that I was in charge of. </p>
                <p>I started by sketching scenes that I wanted to show, and searching for 3D models that would suit the environment. I found a large desert to use as the floorplan, and it looked the most like I remembered the dream. I adjusted the lighting until until it was almost pitch black, but had some purple nighttime shadows.
                </p> 
                   <p>I found lots of McDonalds paraphenalia models, but since I wanted to build a restaurant that you could enter, I decided to build it myself. I referenced photos of different McDonalds’ in an effort to replicate the look as much as possible, so that the surreal environment had enough basis in reality to be recognizable.</p>
           <p>I placed the McDonalds where it was clearly visible, and adjusted the spawn point so that it faced the McDonalds, but also showed the vast landscape. My hope was that people could walk through the space, go into the McDonalds, and see the big world around them. I used an open door and large windows for the McDonalds model so that it was easier to see inside and interact with. For the rain, I used a particle generator at the spawn point, so that the rain let up as the user walked towards the McDonalds.</p>

           <h2>Reflections:</h2>
           <p>The final product was very surreal in appearance. There were some floorplan issues that made it difficult to enter the McDonalds unless the user was flying in Mozilla Hubs, and I wasn’t able to find a good fix. This was my first time doing 3D modeling, and I really enjoyed being able to make a project that mimicked a physical space. To build more on this project, I’d like to refine the McDonalds model to be more polished, and fix the floorplan issues (possibly by building my own desert).</p>
